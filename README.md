# Data-Analysis

These programs are my demonstration on how I have learned to read data from a csv file. Each program answeres a specific question about the dat and organizes the data accordingly as well as creating new files to filter through.
{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}
The data set that I am working with is a collection of all media offered on Netflix throughout the world. I obtained the data from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows

I wanted to answer a few simple question aboout the shows on netflix. The fist was what ratings are the most prevelant for the media on Netflix. The second question was to graph all of the runtimes of movies specifically on Netflix.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
